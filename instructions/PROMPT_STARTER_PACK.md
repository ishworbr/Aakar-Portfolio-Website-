This file contains ready-made prompts for different learning scenarios while building MERN apps.
Use them in ChatGPT to keep your learning structured, step by step, and beginner-friendly.

🔹 1. Code Review Prompt
Here’s my code for <file/path>. Please review it like a senior developer.  

Check for:
1. Correctness and logic  
2. Naming and readability  
3. Edge cases or bugs  
4. Beginner-friendly improvements  
5. One “best practice” habit I should adopt here  

⚠️ Keep feedback concise and structured. If a refactor > 25 lines, just outline the plan instead of pasting full code.

🔹 2. Debugging Help Prompt
I’m stuck. My code/file is here: <paste error or snippet>.  

Help me debug by:
1. Explaining what the error means in simple terms  
2. Suggesting 2–3 possible causes  
3. Guiding me step by step to isolate the issue (not full solution yet)  
4. Only if I’m stuck after trying, show me the exact fix.  

🔹 3. Refactor / Clean-up Prompt
Please help me refactor this code.  

Goals:
- Keep the same functionality  
- Make it cleaner, more readable, and maintainable  
- Use idiomatic React/Node/JS practices  
- Suggest 1–2 “next level” improvements I should learn  

⚠️ If the refactor is long, outline the plan first.

🔹 4. Concept Deep Dive Prompt
I don’t fully understand this concept. Teach me in depth.  

1. Explain it step by step in beginner-friendly terms.  
2. Use a real-world analogy.  
3. Show a tiny (≤10 lines) code example.  
4. Give me 1–2 short exercises to try myself.  
5. Show me a slightly advanced example from real-world use.  


👉 Quick cheat sheet:

Deep dive: explain simply → give analogy → tiny code example → 1–2 practice questions → optional advanced example.

🔹 5. Mini Project / Challenge Prompt
Give me a mini-challenge to practice <concept>.  

Requirements:
1. It should be solvable in 20–30 minutes.  
2. Start with a simple version.  
3. Suggest one “bonus” improvement if I finish early.  
4. Don’t show me the solution unless I ask.  

🔹 6. Explain Tradeoffs Prompt
I see two options for solving <problem>. Can you compare them?  

- Pros and cons of each option  
- Which one is better for beginners vs production  
- One simple rule of thumb I can remember  

🔹 7. Checklist Prompt
I just implemented <feature>. Give me a quick checklist to confirm it’s correct.  
Focus on:
- Functionality  
- Edge cases  
- Code quality  
- UI/UX basics (if frontend)  

🔹 8. File Structure Prompt
For <feature/project>, suggest a clean file/folder structure.  

Rules:  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to navigate  
- Show only folders and filenames (no code)  
- Explain why each folder exists in 1 line  

🔹 9. Learning Reflection Prompt
Summarize what I learned today in 5 bullet points.  

Also:  
- Suggest one area I should review tomorrow  
- Suggest one micro-task I can try next to reinforce today’s learning  

🔹 10. Stretch Goal Prompt
I’m comfortable with <concept>.  

Give me a stretch goal:  
1. Slightly harder than my current level  
2. Realistic for 1–2 hours of effort  
3. Related to real-world development  
4. Include 1 resource (doc, tutorial, article) if relevant
