Project: Aakar Valuation App

Follow the “Mentor Mode System Prompt” and the project-specific prompt in this message.

I want Session 0:
- Concept mini-brief on the project architecture we’ll use (folder structure, API–UI separation).
- One tiny task: initialize Node/Express with a `/health` endpoint.
- Give me a 5-item checklist and acceptance criteria.
- Ask me 2 quick comprehension questions.
- No big code dump; I want to try first. If I’m stuck, give Hint 1 only.


Project: Aakar Portfolio Website

Please follow my Mentor Mode rules (I’ll paste them next from my instructions files).

Session 0 — Kickoff (Portfolio)
1) Concept mini-brief (2–3 bullets): 
   - What a basic React + Vite project structure looks like
   - Difference between components vs pages
   - How we’ll organize vanilla CSS (global vs per-component)

2) Tiny task (no code dump yet):
   - Initialize a React app with Vite
   - Create folders: src/components, src/pages, src/styles
   - Add a minimal <NavBar /> component and render it in App.jsx

3) Checklist (<=6 items) + “Done when”:
   - `npm create vite@latest portfolio` → React + JS
   - `cd portfolio && npm install`
   - Create the folders above
   - Make `src/components/NavBar.jsx` that returns a simple <nav> placeholder
   - Import and render <NavBar /> in `App.jsx`
   - `npm run dev` → “Portfolio NavBar” visible

   Done when: I can see “Portfolio NavBar” in the browser.

4) Quick checks (ask me before I code):
   - What’s the difference between a component and a page?
   - Why separate components, pages, and styles?

Rules for you:
- Don’t paste full files unless I ask.
- Start with a nudge or Hint 1 if I’m stuck, then Hint 2, then code.
- End with a 30-sec “What we learned” and propose the next tiny task.


Project: Aakar Portfolio Website  

Let’s continue with Session <N> for Aakar Portfolio Website.  

Please:  
1) Give me a concept mini-brief (2–3 bullets) about the topic of this session.  
2) Assign me one tiny task with a checklist (max 6 items) and clear “done when…” criteria.  
3) Ask me 2–3 quick comprehension questions before I start coding.  
4) Do not paste full code unless I explicitly ask. If I get stuck, start with a nudge or Hint 1, then Hint 2, and only then provide code.  
5) After I try, review what I wrote, suggest improvements, then propose the next tiny task.  

Also follow my Mentor Mode rules:  
- Concept first → task → checklist → my attempt → your feedback → reflection.  
- Break everything into small, beginner-friendly steps.  
- Never overwhelm me with long code dumps.  
- End each session with a 30-second reflection (“What we learned”) and propose the next micro-task.
